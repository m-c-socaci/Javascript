Example 4 -Arrays and Loops 

Write a script that prints the user's name and phone number to the console. 
The `names` and `phones` variables store strings of names and phone numbers,
separated by commas. The sequence number of names and phone numbers in the lines 
indicates a match.  
 The number of names and phone numbers is guaranteed to be the same.
